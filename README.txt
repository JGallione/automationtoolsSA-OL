!!!Stay updated with python and stay golden!!! (psst: dont be using python2)

When first running this app, make sure to... 

chmod a+x Startup_Build.sh && Run.sh

... in terminal.

after build. best practice is to choose option "exit". then delete the file...

Startup_Build.sh

now you should be able to...

./Run.sh

and choose a python script to run.
the env is activated and deactivated in the Run.sh file 
...although theres really only one "selenium" getting pulled at the moment...
as more libs get added... having a seperate Build/Run will be nice :)
